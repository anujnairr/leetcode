# Count Good Triplets
# Given an array of integers arr, and three integers a, b and c. You need to find the number of good triplets.

# A triplet (arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]) is good if the following conditions are true:

# 0 <= i < j < k < arr.length
# |arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a
# |arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b
# |arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c
# Where |x| denotes the absolute value of x.

# Return the number of good triplets.
arr = [3, 0, 1, 1, 9, 7]
a = 7
b = 2
c = 3
count = 0

# no better solution found.

for i in range(len(arr)-2):
    for j in range(i+1, len(arr) - 1):
        for k in range(j+1, len(arr)):
            if abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= a and abs(arr[j] - arr[k]) <= b and abs(arr[i] - arr[k]) <= c:
                count += 1

print(count)
